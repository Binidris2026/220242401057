## 1. Why is data mining sometimes used to describe the entire knowledge discovery process?
Data mining is the process of analyzing large datasets to discover
patterns, trends, and useful information using algorithms and
statistical methods.

**Answer:**\
Although data mining is technically only one step in the Knowledge
Discovery in Databases (KDD) process, many industries and media sources
use the term to describe the entire workflow. This happens because: -
Data mining is the most *visible* and *exciting* part of KDD---it
produces the actual insights. - People outside academia are less
familiar with preprocessing, cleaning, or transformation steps, so they
use "data mining" as a simpler umbrella term. - Companies often market
their products as "data mining tools" even when they include full KDD
functionalities.

As a result, the term becomes generalized to represent the entire
end‑to‑end knowledge discovery pipeline.



## 2. Differences between data wrangling, scanning, and filtering in data mining

### **Data Wrangling**

Data wrangling (or data cleaning) is the process of transforming raw
data into a structured, usable format.

**Key Points:**
- Handles missing data
- Removes duplicates
- Fixes inconsistencies
- Prepares data for analysis



### **Scanning**

Scanning is the process of quickly reviewing large datasets to identify
patterns, anomalies, or areas that need deeper analysis.

**Key Points:**
- Provides a broad overview
- Helps detect outliers or unusual trends
- Often used as an exploratory step



### **Filtering**

Filtering is the process of selecting specific data based on conditions
or criteria.

**Key Points:**
- Removes irrelevant information
- Focuses on rows/columns that are meaningful
- Reduces dataset size for faster analysis
