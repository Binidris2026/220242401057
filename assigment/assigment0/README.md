## 1. why is data mining sometimes used to describe the entire knowledge discovery process?
Data mining is the process of analyzing large datasets to discover patterns, trends and useful information using algorithms andstatistical methods.Although data mining is technically only one step in the knowledge discovery process, many industries and media sources use the term to describe the entire workflow.This happens because, data mining is the most visible and exciting part of knowledge discovery process, it produces the actual insights.People outside academia are less familiar with preprocessing, cleaning, or transformation steps, so they use data mining as a simpler umbrella term.Companies often market their products as data mining tools even when they include full knowledge discovery process functionalities.
As a result the term becomes generalized to represent the entire end to end knowledge discovery pipeline.



## 2. Differencies between data wrangling, scanning and filtering in data mining

### **Data wrangling**

Data wrangling is the process of transforming raw data into a structured, usable format.

**Key points:**\
-It handles missing data\
-It removes duplicates\
-It fixes inconsistencies\
-It prepares data for analysis



### **Scanning**

Scanning is the process of quickly reviewing large datasets to identify
patterns, anomalies or areas that need deeper analysis.

**Key points:**\
-It provides a broad overview\
-It helps detect outliers or unusual trends\
-It often used as an exploratory step



### **Filtering**

Filtering is the process of selecting specific data based on conditions
or criteria.

**Key point:**\
-It removes irrelevant information\
-It focuses on rows or columns that are meaningful\
-It reduces dataset size for faster analysis
